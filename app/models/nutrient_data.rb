  # Statistical comments. See definitions below.
  # Definitions of each statistical comment included in the Nutrient Data table follow:
  # 1.	The displayed summary statistics were computed from data containing some less-than
  #     values. Less-than, trace, and not-detected values were calculated.
  # 2.	The displayed degrees of freedom were computed using Satterthwaiteâ€™s approximation (Korz
  #     and Johnson, 1988).
  # 3.	The procedure used to estimate the reliability of the generic mean requires that the data
  #     associated with each study be a simple random sample from all the products associated with
  #     the given data source (for example, manufacturer, variety, cultivar, and species).
  # 4.	For this nutrient, one or more data sources had only one observation. Therefore, the standard
  #     errors, degrees of freedom, and error bounds were computed from the between-group standard
  #     deviation of the weighted groups having only one observation.
